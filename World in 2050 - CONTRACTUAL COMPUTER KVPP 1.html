However, there also some reasons to worry about life in the year 2050. <INS><STRONG>The more modern the technologies will be the much polluted environment we have.</STRONG></INS> <INS><STRONG>Nevertheless, future scientists will pay more attention to this aspect so I think it will be improved soon.</STRONG></INS> Because of technologies, people will be much passive than at present. There will be robots helping people in many aspects of their lives. People won't need to do housework or cook for meals because robots do them all. <INS><STRONG>Because we can study at home so people will use computers almost every day,</STRONG></INS> which make they become much <INS><STRONG>lazier and easier</STRONG></INS> to be fat. There will have a lot of changes in our life in the <INS><STRONG>next 28 years.</STRONG></INS> Whether it a better or worse <STRONG><INS>life depends on what we will do to it</STRONG></INDS and how they can influence our life.<P/>

<P STYLE="FONT-SIZE : 160% ; "><FONT COLOR="WHITE"><INS><STRONG>The world in 2050 is more hostile and less fertile, more crowded and less diverse.</INS></STRONG> Compared with 2019, there are more trees, but fewer forests, more concrete, but less stability. The rich have retreated into air-conditioned sanctums behind ever higher walls. The poor and what is left of other species is left exposed to the ever harsher elements. Everyone is affected by rising prices, conflict, stress and depression. Extreme weather is the overriding concern of all but a tiny elite. <INS><STRONG>It wreaks havoc everywhere,</INS></STRONG> but the greatest misery is felt in poorer countries. <INS><STRONG>Dhaka, Dar es Salaam and other coastal cities</INS></STRONG> are hit almost every year by storm surges and other extreme sea-level incidents that used to occur only once a century. Following the lead set by <INS><STRONG>Jakarta,</INS></STRONG> several capitals have relocated to less-exposed regions. <INS><STRONG>But floods, heatwaves, droughts and fires are increasingly catastrophic. Healthcare systems are struggling to cope.</INS></STRONG> The economic costs cripple poorly prepared financial institutions. Insurance companies refuse to provide cover for natural disasters. Insecurity and desperation sweep through populations. Governments struggle to cope. <INS><STRONG>By 2050, if we fail to act, many of the most damaging, extreme weather events we have seen in recent years will become commonplace,</INS></STRONG>‚Äù warns Michael Mann, the director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. In a world where we see continual weather disasters day after day <INS><STRONG>(which is what we‚Äôll have in the absence of concerted action)</INS></STRONG>, our societal infrastructure may well fail.‚Ä¶.<INS><STRONG>We won‚Äôt see the extinction of our species, but we could well see societal collapse.</INS></STRONG> <P/>

This level represents an increase of more than 25% from 2022.</INS></STRONG> The current global total fertility rate is 2.3 births per woman, although 91 countries and territories have registered fertility rates below replacement level.The World Population Data Sheet is released annually by the Population Reference Bureau. The 2022 edition tracks <INS><STRONG>24 population indicators for more than 200 countries and territories.</INS></STRONG> The 2022 World Population Data Sheet reveals that many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and some in Asia have experienced rapid population growth and high fertility rates. As a result, sub-Saharan Africa has the youngest population of any region, <INS><STRONG>with 43% of its population under age 15.</INS></STRONG> <INS><STRONG>The population of 25 countries is expected to at least double between 2022 and 2050.</INS></STRONG> Among these 25 countries, Angola and Benin are projected to grow by at least <INS><STRONG>150%</INS></STRONG> of their current population. Niger‚Äôs population is expected to increase by almost <INS><STRONG>175%.</INS></STRONG> By contrast, the trend is towards a graying population in Europe. Older adults <INS><STRONG>(ages 65 and older)</INS></STRONG> account for 9%</INS></STRONG> of global population, but in Western Europe and Southern Europe, 21% of the population falls into this category.</INS></STRONG> In 2022, life expectancy at birth for women is highest in Hong Kong and lowest in Central African RepubliC. <INS><STRONG>Life expectancy at birth for men is highest in Australia and lowest in Central African Republic and Lesotho.</INS></STRONG><P/>

This technology is more efficient and faster. <INS><STRONG>Information that looses relevance is stored in an iCloud like device that is accessible by the human brain when needed. This advancement will use the functions that our brains complete on a daily basis and will further the memory process and storage system. Ultimately, in the future, information will be retrievable at a blink of an eye.</INS></STRONG> In the year 2050, technology will dominate the workplace with artificial intelligence and smart assistants being commonplace, while the use of augmented and virtual reality continues to increase. Everything will be 'smart' ‚Äì connected and data-driven. ... Technology will help us make organizations more personable. <INS><STRONG>The world of work in 2050.</INS></STRONG> If you‚Äôre unlucky enough not to <INS><STRONG>have retired by then, the working world will be a very different place to how it is today.</INS></STRONG> The vision of the future for workers tends to scale from a nihilistic view of the robots taking our jobs (leaving us permanently trapped indoors, <INS><STRONG>living entirely from Amazon Prime supplies)</INS></STRONG>, through to the utopia of the eradication of repetitive tasks using artificial intelligence.

<P STYLE="FONT-SIZE : 160% ; "><FONT COLOR="WHITE"></STRONG>After a year of major political shocks with the <INS><STRONG>Brexit</INS></STRONG> vote and the <INS><STRONG>election of President Trump,</INS></STRONG> it might seem brave to opine on economic prospects for 2022, let alone 2050.<INS><STRONG> However, I still think it is important to take a longer term view of global economic prospects that looks beyond the short-term ups and downs of the economic and political cycle, which are indeed very difficult to forecast.</INS></STRONG> Instead our approach in this report, based on a rigorous modelling approach, focuses on the fundamental drivers of growth: demographics and productivity, which in turn is driven by <INS><STRONG>technological progress and diffused through international trade and investment.</INS></STRONG> Such forces saw America progress through the 19th and early 20th centuries to become the largest economy in the world despite a civil war, various other conflicts with foreign powers, three presidential assassinations, and numerous economic and <INS><STRONG>financial crises.</INS></STRONG> These forces also helped global economic growth to bounce back strongly from two world wars and a Great Depression to reach record levels in the post-war decades. Looking ahead, we think they will see emerging economies come to dominate the 21st century. <INS><STRONG>By 2050 we project China will be the largest economy in the world by a significant margin, while India could have edged past the US into second place and Indonesia have risen to fourth place.</INS></STRONG> The EU27‚Äôs share of global GDP could have fallen to below 10%. We also think the world economy will more than double in size between now and 2050, far outstripping population growth. I think this kind of long-term view, looking beyond short-term economic and political cycles, is particularly useful for policymakers and businesses in areas <INS><STRONG>like pensions, healthcare, energy and climate change, transport, housing and other types of infrastructure investment.</INS></STRONG><P/>
